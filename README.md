# EduSync

EduSync is a solution designed to address the difficulties in understanding AICTE's Approval Process Handbook. The web portal streamlines the approval process for technical institutions. This portal would allow institutions and stakeholders to input their specific course and infrastructural requirements, and in return, the portal provides all the required documents, along with the fee structure.

An AI-based chatbot was implemented in the portal to address user-specific needs and give recommendations based on the prompts and the document that users submit. The portal is made available in various indic-based languages.
